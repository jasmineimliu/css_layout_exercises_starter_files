# CSS Layout Exercises

This application contains three exercises: display page, float page and position page. Each exercise is targeted toward practicing the respective css properties. 

## Display Property

Use the display property (and any other required properties) to write CSS rules that accomplish the design. Remember, don't set the display property for all elements. Remember that elements have default display values, and you should only override them when you have a specific reason to (and to be clear, you will need to explicitly set display values in at least one style rule for this exercise).

## Position Property

* Use the position property (and any other required properties) to write CSS rules for the given design. First do the nav bar, which is fixed. We've given you the HTML you need, you just need to write and add classes as necessary.
* To implement the dotted green box, you can use border: 10px green dotted.
* Next do the dotted green box with the cat and dog images. To complete this part of the challenge, you'll have to use position:relative and position:absolute, along with offsets. But that's as much of a hint as we're giving you!
* Finally, try to implement the background image. It should scale to the width of the browser window.

# CSS Layout Exercises

This application contains three exercises: display page, float page and position page. Each exercise is targeted toward practicing the respective css properties. 

## Display Property

Use the display property (and any other required properties) to write CSS rules that accomplish the design above. Remember, don't set the display property for all elements. Remember that elements have default display values, and you should only override them when you have a specific reason to (and to be clear, you will need to explicitly set display values in at least one style rule for this exercise).
